# LogisticRegression
A logistic regression program using python and NumPy to classify four inputs as a backslash or not

LR is the first version where inputs contain 5 elements, the first element is the weight for the bias

LR2 is the second and improved version. The bias is a separate variable and the training uses epochs instead of a certain amount of iterations
